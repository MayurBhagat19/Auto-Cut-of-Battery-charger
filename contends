The project focuses on the design and development of an Auto Cut-off Battery Charger 
system. In today's technologically driven world, batteries play a crucial role in powering a 
wide range of devices and equipment. However, improper charging practices, such as 
overcharging, can lead to reduced battery lifespan and potential safety hazards. The aim of 
this project is to create a smart charging system that detects the battery's charging and 
discharging stage and terminates the charging process once battery reaches the desired 
capacity.
